            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p class="text-wrap padtop">
              All of the stats that were stated above were taken from a group of 61 users. From that time I did a competitive analysis of not only food truck apps, but also restaurant apps. As I stated before, a lot of restaurant apps had compelling features and were honestly putting the food truck apps to shame. The restaurant apps that I studied were Open Table and Eat Street. What impressed me most about OpenTable is they knew their vision and why they existed. The first CTAs I saw from the homepage were simply to reserve tables and edit this request very accurately and quickly. The design was stunning and the layout was very intuitive. These were some things I wanted to carry to the Chow Town app. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrap padtop">
              The other two apps I was able to study were Street Food Finder and WTF (Where the FoodTruck). I focused more on nationally driven food truck apps rather than local because I wanted Chow Town to focus on a larger area other than local. Street Food Finder in my opinion was the superior app due to its simplicity and branding. Although neither of these apps seem up-to-date aesthetically, they did a fairly good job at finding food trucks. Street Food Finder had some key features such as list of food types, choosing choice of distance (.5 mi, 1mi, 5mi, 10mi, 25mi) to find a food truck, and can select from a list of available food trucks in the area. The issue with this was there were no menus provided, hardly any photos, and no reviews of each food truck. This app was quite limited with it's features unfortunately.   
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrap padtop">After this competitive analysis it was obvious to me that ChowTown needed to look and feel like a modern app. It also needed to have a clear vision of what it wanted to accomplish to help individuals find food trucks around their area.</p>

            <p class="text-wrap padtop">
              From my user stories I was able to create user flows. The largest user flow I thought through was the login process. The biggest reason is because I included a way to login from multiple different avenues. The reason behind this was if the vision for ChowTown was to make people more aware of food trucks around their area and there is an app to find food trucks then social media like facebook could encourage this marketing idea. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrap padtop">I wanted to make other actions quicker because I wanted the user experience to be simpler and easy to use.</p>

              The initial wireframes that were tested were based on the user stories and flows that were created previously. Interestingly enough, the main things that 3 users said could use improvement was:
            </p>
            <ol class="padtop">
              <li>1. A better flow to finding the restaurant in a map view</li>

            <p class="text-wrap padtop">
              Every user was actually impressed by how well the app did and how well it focused on the critical features. I mainly focused on updating these changes in the high fidelity mockups as I moved forward.

            <p class="text-wrap padtop">
              In this process I mainly looked at restaurant apps I used before to gain inspiration and how to set Chow Town apart from these. I chose Chow Town because it conveys food and throughout a town or city. This was intentional incase this business wanted to be more than simply food trucks down the road and implement features that would include hole-in-the-wall restaurants that not many have heard of either. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrap padtop">
              Through some preference tests I landed with variations of red instead of green, blue, or orange, since many restaurant apps use those colors already.

              The one feedback I received from a user was to make sure they could favorite a food truck since in the accounts page favorites you notice a food truck was chosen, but the functionality was not included within the prototype. Therefore, I revised this along with a larger reconstruction of the user flow.

              I was advised by a Senior Designer to allow users to “play” with the app before committing to sign up. This was incredibly insightful when I was given a link to read in the apple human interface guidelines about this approach. This wasn’t apparent to me initially, but I was able to implement this within the final prototype.

            <p class="padx padtop">Surprisingly every user that tested my app said it was intuitive and they really liked it a lot. They were impressed by how natural the experience was and was great overall. There were some things that were asked to be added that I feel would be a feature to implement in the future such as choosing a certain distance you'd like to populate the food trucks by rather than a default of 25 miles for instance. I also felt this could be a future implementation because users were still able to get a list of food trucks available to them and link them to their maps to get there. Location was pivotal for the majority of users.</p> 

            <p class="pad">I had doubts about the ability to find a problem within this application, but interestingly enough as I did more competitive analysis I realized there is a lot of room to play within this market. And plenty of areas to improve on for that matter.</p>
                
            <p class="pad no-padtop">I think what I would have done differently is made sure to make a more fully fledged prototype that had conditional logic for certain paths people would have taken to make it even that much more natural. I would have also wanted to improve the logo.</p>

            <p class="pad">A fun fact that I learned is the majority of people love mexican food regardless if they’re vegan or not. On a more serious note I learned more about the process of user research which was incredible. I’m thankful to have had 61 people to take my test. I feel I had a considerable amount of data to sift through and I really enjoyed finding key insights from this data.</p>           
            
            <p class="pad">Overall this was a great experience and it taught me to always test as much as you can so you can verify your assumptions as a UX/UI Designer.</p>
