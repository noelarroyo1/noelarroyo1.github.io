            Since I was 7, I had a strong desire to use my artistic abilities to
            communicate emotion and articulate my passions. I remember a special
            birthday card I designed for my Mom. Her joy, when receiving it, is what
            fueled my desire to design. The medium makes no difference, whether it
            be a crayon, pencil, pen, or spray-can, creativity always flows. What
            first started as a joy to draw cartoons I watched on a Saturday morning,
            eventually evolved into an art that was inspired by the streets of
            Chicago. The incredible combination of high contrasting colors found in
            graffiti-inspired me and left me mesmerized.
          </p>
          <p class="pad">
            This led me to pick up a spray-can and painting murals. The graffiti world has rules, which challenges me to continually push the boundaries creatively, despite the apparent limitations. There is no difference no matter the canvas, whether it be a wall, a piece of paper, or in Illustrator, I will continue to push myself creatively.
          </p>
          </p>
          <p class="pad">
            Design fascinates me because it resonates with people to their core. I
            think of the houses we live in and the skyscrapers we see in the cities.
            The chair that we sit on to the planes we fly in. Even the musical
            instruments we hear played in our favorite songs. Design has truly made
            an impact on this world.
          </p>
          <p class="pad">
              My career didn’t start as a designer, previously I was a Music Director. I love singing, playing guitar and piano. This was another way of expressing myself creatively to connect with people around me. While working in this capacity, I explored opportunities to design. I created logos and branding because I truly enjoyed it. I wanted to learn the tools of the trade and how to improve my creative outlet. This led to shifting my focus to a designing career.
            </p>
            <p class="pad">
                I seek, through design, to help serve people. Being a Music Director for local churches has helped me build empathy for real-life struggles. Whether my designs will help non-profit organizations or push the limits on an already existing application, I hope to simply give people a great experience, while solving their everyday struggles. Designing is my life.
