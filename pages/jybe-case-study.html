                In a time where data is multiplying exponentially we are in need of more options to store it. We have cloud services provided by major corporations, but there is still room to play. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrap padtop">
                Surprisingly, users are looking for something more simplistic. They wanted syncing to be flawless so only one application is needed to manage opposed to several. The majority of users save their life moments and other important documents within the cloud.  
            </p>
            <p class="text-wrap padtop">
                Jybe is a cloud application that allows seamless syncing to access information whether by phone or desktop. It also promotes easy sharing of life moments or important documents in a fast way without sacrificing it’s simplicity.

          <div class="conclusion no-padtop">
            <p class="padx padtop">Overall, this experience was incredible. Going into the project with the client not knowing a lot of their target audience or important functionalities gave me encouragement to see UX/UI design is not something to skip if you want a truly successful app.</p> 

            <p class="pad">Initially I was a bit nervous to start a project where the client essentially said, “Here is what we think we want, but we need you to confirm this is the right direction”. I was absolutely blown away by what I learned from users using cloud service platforms.</p>
                
            <p class="pad">Some of the things that surprised me were that the majority of people were not stingy when it came to purchasing a cloud application. If that meant that their files were safe, secure, and they had plenty of space to store data then they were willing to pay a premium. In fact I believe this had some correlation with the fact that the majority of users used their cloud services for personal use and that in large, video was the main data type to save. Again, this was because of personal memories or experiences from follow-up.</p>

            <p class="pad">This also leads to the other point that surprised me is that the majority of users did not use a cloud service in order to store business documents or use it for work, but for personal use. They wanted a laptop/mobile app that synced perfectly. This is because they wanted control of when, where, and how they were going to organize or share their data. Work was still important but it was not the primary priority it was second.</p>           
            
            <p class="pad">When my prototypes were tested to make a product very appealing to a young professional, I believe the simplistic design, color scheme, and straight forward instruction did it all for them. The users who tested the prototype were able to perform primary and secondary tasks flawlessly the second round. The only reason why some may have had an issue was because they may have been distracted during their time of the testing unfortunately.</p>
                
            <p class="pad">If I were to go back and improve on my workflow it would have to be putting the research more in front of me. Although I did use my research throughout I know there could have been tiny tweaks to the design to accommodate small preferences or produce a tighter MVP. If I had more time I would have loved to put a more full fledged prototype with animations that could draw the persons/users attention at a much greater level and create a more “real” experience.</p>
                  
            <p class="pad">Creating Jybe was a blast and I was grateful to have taken part in this particular project!</p>
