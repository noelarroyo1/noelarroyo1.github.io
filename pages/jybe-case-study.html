        <h2>Problem/Solution</h2>
        <p>
          In a time where data is multiplying exponentially we are in need of
          more options to store it. We have cloud services provided by major
          corporations, but there is still room to play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, users are looking for something more simplistic. They
          wanted syncing to be flawless so only one application is needed to
          manage opposed to several. The majority of users save their life
          moments and other important documents within the cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jybe is a cloud application that allows seamless syncing to access
          information whether by phone or desktop. It also promotes easy sharing
          of life moments or important documents in a fast way without
          sacrificing it’s simplicity.

      <section class="discovery">
        <h2>Discovery &amp; Research</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>

            <strong>83%</strong> use cloud service for work related endeavors
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>89%</strong> user under the age of 45 use cloud services

          </li>
          >
          <li><strong>78%</strong> of all users upload videos</li>
          >
          <li>

            <strong>55%</strong> of users heard of Dropbox and use this cloud
            service
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With this information I geared Jybe toward young professionals. Since
          the majority of individuals used cloud services for personal use I
          geared this to be friend and family oriented. There still needed to be
          a way to aim it toward work related information too so finding the
          right vibe proved itself difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also looked for particular ways to mimic Dropbox in it’s design to
          help the user feel more at ease. I wanted the user to feel Jybe was
          familiar, yet still dealing with a totally different application with
          different features.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also knew to compete with larger companies I needed to provide
          larger storage for cheaper pricing since the majority of users were
          uploading videos.

            As I was given this information I was able to perform a competitive
            analysis of competing businesses such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and
            Evernote.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also found that the onboarding process for 2 out of the 3 I
            researched were quite extensive. If simplicity were key in using
            this app and having it perform well as an MVP then I knew I needed
            to make it a quick and easy onboarding experience as well. This
            definitely influenced the login process by simply providing a
            username and email.

            As I created my user stories I went on to do user flows to help
            think through the process of the user stories created. This
            definitely helped me think through logically what the user would
            experience before designing.

          Overall I already had an initial thought of what I believed the web

          designed a wireframe digitally as well in order to put them in front
          of the user to test out. First I created the wireframe digitally then
          I designed a low-fidelity mockup.

          I thought initially I knew what I was going to name this application.
          Since it was a cloud app I wanted to name it something more related to
          clouds like Nimbus, but through a mind-mapping exercise I found this
          was not the case.

          The majority of these changes and iterations that were needed were
          based on spacing inconsistencies, text resizing, or placing items in
          different spots because it made more sense logically to the user. Here

      <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, this experience was incredible. Going into the project with
          the client not knowing a lot of their target audience or important
          functionalities gave me encouragement to see UX/UI design is not
          something to skip if you want a truly successful app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially I was a bit nervous to start a project where the client
          essentially said, “Here is what we think we want, but we need you to
          confirm this is the right direction”. I was absolutely blown away by
          what I learned from users using cloud service platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the things that surprised me were that the majority of people
          were not stingy when it came to purchasing a cloud application. If
          that meant that their files were safe, secure, and they had plenty of
          space to store data then they were willing to pay a premium. In fact I
          believe this had some correlation with the fact that the majority of
          users used their cloud services for personal use and that in large,
          video was the main data type to save. Again, this was because of
          personal memories or experiences from follow-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also leads to the other point that surprised me is that the
          majority of users did not use a cloud service in order to store
          business documents or use it for work, but for personal use. They
          wanted a laptop/mobile app that synced perfectly. This is because they
          wanted control of when, where, and how they were going to organize or
          share their data. Work was still important but it was not the primary
          priority it was second.
        </p>
        <p>
          When my prototypes were tested to make a product very appealing to a
          young professional, I believe the simplistic design, color scheme, and
          straight forward instruction did it all for them. The users who tested
          the prototype were able to perform primary and secondary tasks
          flawlessly the second round. The only reason why some may have had an
          issue was because they may have been distracted during their time of
          the testing unfortunately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were to go back and improve on my workflow it would have to be
          putting the research more in front of me. Although I did use my
          research throughout I know there could have been tiny tweaks to the
          design to accommodate small preferences or produce a tighter MVP. If I
          had more time I would have loved to put a more full fledged prototype
          with animations that could draw the persons/users attention at a much
          greater level and create a more “real” experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating Jybe was a blast and I was grateful to have taken part in
          this particular project!
