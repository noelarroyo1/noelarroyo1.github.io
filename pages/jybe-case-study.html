          <h2>Problem/Solution</h2>
          <p>
            In a time where data is multiplying exponentially we are in need of
            more options to store it. We have cloud services provided by major
            corporations, but there is still room to play.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, users are looking for something more simplistic. They
            wanted syncing to be flawless so only one application is needed to
            manage opposed to several. The majority of users save their life
            moments and other important documents within the cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jybe is a cloud application that allows seamless syncing to access
            information whether by phone or desktop. It also promotes easy
            sharing of life moments or important documents in a fast way without
            sacrificing it’s simplicity.

        <h2>Discovery &amp; Research</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>94%</strong> use their cloud service app for personal use
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>83%</strong> use cloud service for work related endeavors
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>89%</strong> user under the age of 45 use cloud services
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>73%</strong> of users are considered young professionals
          </li>
          <li><strong>78%</strong> of all users upload videos</li>
          <li>
            <strong>73%</strong> upload images and word/pdfs/excel documents
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>55%</strong> of users heard of Dropbox and use this cloud
            service
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With this information I geared Jybe toward young professionals. Since
          the majority of individuals used cloud services for personal use I
          geared this to be friend and family oriented. There still needed to be
          a way to aim it toward work related information too so finding the
          right vibe proved itself difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also looked for particular ways to mimic Dropbox in it’s design to
          help the user feel more at ease. I wanted the user to feel Jybe was
          familiar, yet still dealing with a totally different application with
          different features.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also knew to compete with larger companies I needed to provide
          larger storage for cheaper pricing since the majority of users were
          uploading videos.

            analysis of competing businesses such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and
            Evernote.

          <p>
            I also found that the onboarding process for 2 out of the 3 I
            researched were quite extensive. If simplicity were key in using
            this app and having it perform well as an MVP then I knew I needed
            to make it a quick and easy onboarding experience as well. This
            definitely influenced the login process by simply providing a
            username and email.

            The majority of these changes and iterations that were needed were

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Overall, this experience was incredible. Going into the project with
            the client not knowing a lot of their target audience or important
            functionalities gave me encouragement to see UX/UI design is not
            something to skip if you want a truly successful app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially I was a bit nervous to start a project where the client
            essentially said, “Here is what we think we want, but we need you to
            confirm this is the right direction”. I was absolutely blown away by
            what I learned from users using cloud service platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the things that surprised me were that the majority of
            people were not stingy when it came to purchasing a cloud
            application. If that meant that their files were safe, secure, and
            they had plenty of space to store data then they were willing to pay
            a premium. In fact I believe this had some correlation with the fact
            that the majority of users used their cloud services for personal
            use and that in large, video was the main data type to save. Again,
            this was because of personal memories or experiences from follow-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            This also leads to the other point that surprised me is that the
            majority of users did not use a cloud service in order to store
            business documents or use it for work, but for personal use. They
            wanted a laptop/mobile app that synced perfectly. This is because
            they wanted control of when, where, and how they were going to
            organize or share their data. Work was still important but it was
            not the primary priority it was second.

            When my prototypes were tested to make a product very appealing to a
            young professional, I believe the simplistic design, color scheme,
            and straight forward instruction did it all for them. The users who
            tested the prototype were able to perform primary and secondary
            tasks flawlessly the second round. The only reason why some may have
            had an issue was because they may have been distracted during their
            time of the testing unfortunately.

            If I were to go back and improve on my workflow it would have to be
            putting the research more in front of me. Although I did use my
            research throughout I know there could have been tiny tweaks to the
            design to accommodate small preferences or produce a tighter MVP. If
            I had more time I would have loved to put a more full fledged
            prototype with animations that could draw the persons/users
            attention at a much greater level and create a more “real”
            experience.

            this particular project!
